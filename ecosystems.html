            <h2 class="titlebar">OVERFISHING PUTS SPECIES AT RISK</h2>
            <p>One third of all shark and ray species are endangered from overfishing.</p>
            <p>Overfishing creates competition between humans and sharks, lowering their chance of survival.</p>
            <p>In addition, dragnets can catch and tangle sharks, leading to dismemberment or death.</p>

            <h2 class="titlebar">OVERFISHING DISRUPTS ECOSYSTEMS</h2>
            <p>Dragnet fishing is the practice of catching fish with huge nets that drag along the sea floor.</p>
            <p>This practice is very harmful, as the net can destroy ecosystems as it sweeps along.</p>
            <p>Fish traps set underwater can damage sensitive enviornments such as coral reefs, which take a long time to recover.</p>

            <h2 class="titlebar">OVERFISHING HURTS REPRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Many fish gather together in large populations to mate at predictable times of the year.</p>
            <p>Harvesting from these schools greatly hurts the fish population, as it impedes the fish population's ability to rebound.</p>
            <p>In addition, nearshore habitats are sometimes vital place for young fish to grow up. Fishing from these environments also removes young fish before they have a chance to grow up and replenish the population.</p>
