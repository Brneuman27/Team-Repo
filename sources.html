    <img id="works-cited-fish" src="fish.jpg" alt="A slightly derpy-looking fish, with bulging eyes that seem perpetually gobsmacked, drifts about aimlessly in the water. Its scales, though shimmering with a silvery hue, appear a bit tatty and patchy in places, giving it a somewhat scruffy look. The fish’s fins flap about in a rather haphazard manner, as if it’s not quite got the hang of using them properly. Its gob is slightly agape, forming an ‘O’ shape that adds to its gormless expression, making it look like it’s just seen something utterly barmy. The fish’s body is a bit wonky, with a noticeable lopsidedness that adds to its comical charm. Its overall appearance is a bit daft, like it’s not the sharpest tool in the shed, but there’s something endearing about its peculiar look. The fish’s eyes are large and round, almost cartoonish, and its movements are slow and uncoordinated, as if it’s in a constant state of befuddlement. This fish looks like it could be the poster child for ‘not all there,’ but it’s proper funny in its own unique way. A right laugh, this one, and a bit of a numpty to boot! You half expect it to start posing dramatically, as if it’s about to embark on some bizarre adventure. Its fins, flapping about like they’re trying to perform some sort of underwater technique, add to the hilarity. The fish’s scales, though a bit tatty, have a certain shimmer that reminds you of a creature ready to evolve, perhaps into something equally daft but with a bit more flair. As it bobs along, you can’t help but think it might suddenly react to its own reflection, mistaking it for a rival. Its eyes, wide and round, give it a look of perpetual astonishment, as if it’s just seen something extraordinary for the first time. The fish’s movements are slow and uncoordinated, almost as if it’s trying to perform a complex dance but failing miserably. Despite its daft appearance, there’s something undeniably charming about this fish. It’s the kind of creature you’d expect to find in a quirky story, always getting into silly situations but somehow coming out unscathed. In the end, this fish is a proper character, a bit of a numpty but with a heart of gold. Its gormless expression and wonky body make it endearing in a way that’s hard to describe. You can’t help but root for it, hoping it finds its way in the vast ocean, perhaps even discovering its own hidden power. Whether it’s channeling its inner hero, attempting a special move, or dreaming of evolving into a majestic form, this fish is a right laugh and a joy to behold">
