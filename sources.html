    <img id="works-cited-fish" src="fish.jpg" alt="A slightly derpy-looking fish, with bulging eyes that seem perpetually gobsmacked, drifts about aimlessly in the water. Its scales, though shimmering with a silvery hue, appear a bit tatty and patchy in places, giving it a somewhat scruffy look. The fish’s fins flap about in a rather haphazard manner, as if it’s not quite got the hang of using them properly. Its gob is slightly agape, forming an ‘O’ shape that adds to its gormless expression, making it look like it’s just seen something utterly barmy. The fish’s body is a bit wonky, with a noticeable lopsidedness that adds to its comical charm. Its overall appearance is a bit daft, like it’s not the sharpest tool in the shed, but there’s something endearing about its peculiar look. The fish’s eyes are large and round, almost cartoonish, and its movements are slow and uncoordinated, as if it’s in a constant state of befuddlement. This fish looks like it could be the poster child for ‘not all there,’ but it’s proper funny in its own unique way. A right laugh, this one, and a bit of a numpty to boot! You half expect it to start posing dramatically, as if it’s about to embark on some bizarre adventure.">
